Update Your Test Case Dictionaries: This is the most critical manual step. You must edit each test_...py file. For every dictionary in the test_cases list, you need to:

Add a 'compiler_version' key: 'compiler_version': 'V1' or 'compiler_version': 'V2'.
Simplify the 'expected' key: It should only be the filename, not the path.
Example (test/compiler_versions/V1/examples/test_arithmetic.py)

How to Run the New Test System
You will now run tests from the project's root directory (py2c64/).

Run all tests for all versions:

python test/main.py

Run only the tests for a specific file:

python test/main.py V1/test_arithmetic.py

Regenerate all expected outputs for V2:
First, ensure the V2 compiler is working as you want.
Then, you can run regeneration for just V2 by specifying each file,
or more practically, temporarily modify the load_test_cases function
to only look in the V2 directory before running a full regeneration.

For a single file:

python test/main.py --regenerate V2/test_new_feature.py

This unified structure provides a clean, scalable way to manage tests
for different versions of your compiler, keeping their examples and expected
outputs completely isolated.

1) How can I modify `test/main.py` to accept a `--version` flag to only run tests for V1 or V2?
